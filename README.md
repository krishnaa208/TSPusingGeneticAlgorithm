# TSPusingGeneticAlgorithm
Optimizing Travelling Salesman problem using Genetic Algorithm

## To Run the project :

1. git clone https://github.com/krishnaa208/TSPusingGeneticAlgorithm
2. cd TSPusingGeneticAlgorithm
3. Run a local server (few options are listed below)
    * python3 -m http.server (with python3)
    * php -S localhost:8000  (with php)
    * http-server (with npm and http-server installed)
4. Visit link and adjust differed parameters 
5. Click on Start button

## About the Project:

* different parameters for genetic algorithm can easily be adjusted with gui
* by default max no of cities is 24 but you can add more cities into cities.csv file
    with name , latitude and longitude of city
* ga.js contains logic related to genetic algorithms
* sketch.js contains logic for visualization
